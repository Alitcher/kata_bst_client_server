# Tests 🧪

This is "tests" folder that contains the necessary files to build and test the code.

## Test Goals 🎯

The tests in this folder aim to verify the correctness and functionality of the code components, including the Binary Search Tree (BST) and the Client/ServerModel.

## Prerequisites ⚙️

Before proceeding, please make sure that you meet the following requirements:

1. You are running on a Linux machine.
2. You have installed the required dependencies:
   - `cmake`: The build system used for compiling the code.
   - `gtest`: The Google Test framework for running the tests.

## Build ⚙️
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the "tests" directory.
2. Run the following command to configure the build:
  - `cmake .`
  - `make` to build the executable test file.
  - `./BSTTest` to run the test. This will execute the test suite and display the results. 🎉

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

If you encounter any issues during the build or test process, here are a few things you can try:

* Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed and up to date.
* Double-check that you followed the build and test instructions correctly.
* If you still encounter problems, feel free to reach out to me for assistance. 🤝

Happy testing!
