This is "tests" folder that contains the necessary files to build and test the code.

## Prerequisites ⚙️

To build the code and generate the executable, follow these steps:

1. You are running on a Linux machine.
2. Make sure you have all the dependencies installed. `cmake` `gtest`
3. Navigate to the `tests` directory which is where we are now.
4. Open a terminal and execute the following commands:

## Build ⚙️
1. `cmake .`
2. `cmake --build` to build the executable test file.
3. `./BSTTest` to run the test. This will execute the test suite and display the results. 🎉

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

If you encounter any issues during the build or test process, here are a few things you can try:

* Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed and up to date.
* Double-check that you followed the build and test instructions correctly.
